## Download Automation

The current data context can be queried at a static location and provides information about the source date of the current data and source file locations.

```
GET https://www.covid19.admin.ch/api/data/context
```
`sourceDate` contains the overall source date of the data. Multiple publications per day are possible with the same `sourceDate`. Check the `dataVersion` to decide if you need to update your data.

`dataVersion` contains the current data version. Download links may be generated directly using the `dataVersion` but using the pre-generated urls in the `sources` field (see documentation below) is recommended.

`sources` contains information about the source location of all currently available raw source data (zip and individual files) to download as well as the schema version/content. OpenData DCAT-AP-CH metadata information will be published in the future in addition to this API to further facilitate automation of data downloads.
